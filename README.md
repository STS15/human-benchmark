After watching CodeBullet's video on automating the typing test, I was inspired to replicate the experiment using JavaScript. In his video, CodeBullet showcased the use of Python, Selenium, and pyautoguiâ€”all of which are highly efficient tools. However, he did encounter challenges, especially with the time it took to loop through the span elements. 

I opted for a different approach:
- Leveraged a programming language I'm well-versed in: **JavaScript**.
- Used **Playwright** as a substitute for Selenium.
- Simplified the process by anchoring to the parent element and merging the innerText of its children into a unified string.
- Played back the consolidated string leveraging keyup/keydown events.

The result? An average typing speed of **25,797.2 words per minute**.
